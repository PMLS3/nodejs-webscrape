    "description": "Pi2R Micro Solar Geyser Controller only has one mode of operation as it cannot communicate with a display.\\n\\n## Connection without a Display\\n\\nIn this mode temperature can only be set with the existing AC thermostat. No extra settings\\npossible.\\n\\nIn this mode priority is always given to grid power (AC). This enables the unit to be manually\\nforced to use grid when DC power is available but not sufficient. Otherwise when DC is only at\\n10% (for example) then the water cannot be heated up quickly if the user so required.\\n\\nThus to automate functionality, AC needs to be switched through a standard geyser timer. This\\ntimer will enable AC at set times to ensure acceptable water. The timer also ensures that DC is used\\nduring sunlight hours as it removes AC during daytime.\\n\\nContrary to expectation AC is not always used during these times. AC will be available but not\\nused when the geyser is warm enough\\n\\n## Override\\n\\nThe geyser can be manually overridden in order to heat up once-off. Overrides will not repeat\\nautomatically.\\n\\n## Timers\\n\\nTwo independent timers can be set when AC may be used.\\nContrary to expectation AC is not always used during these times.\\nAC will not be used when:\\n\\n* Water is warm enough\\n* Loadshedding\\n\\n## Temperatures\\n\\nTwo independent temperatures can be set. One for AC and one for DC/PV.\\nWhen the Temperature reaches the AC set-point then the unit will switch to PV power if available\\n(even during Timer operation).\\nIt is therefore important to set the AC temperature lower than the DC temperature, otherwise power\\nsaving will be hindered.\\n\\n## City of Capetown\\n\\nBoth Pi2R Micro Solar Geyser Controller and iX can be used under Capetown regulations, both are NRCS approved as\\nrequired.",

Otherwise when DC is only at\\n10% (for example) then the water cannot be heated up quickly if the user so required.\\n\\nThus to automate functionality, AC needs to be switched through a standard geyser timer. This\\ntimer will enable AC at set times to ensure acceptable water. The timer also ensures that DC is used\\nduring sunlight hours as it removes AC during daytime.\\n\\nContrary to expectation AC is not always used during these times.
