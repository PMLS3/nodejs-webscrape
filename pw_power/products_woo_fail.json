      "description": "Deye 16kw Hybrid Inverter, is suitable for residential and light commercial use, maximizing self-consumption rate of solar energy and increasing your energy impendence. &nbsp; \\nDuring the day, the PV system generates electricity which will be provided to the loads initially. Then, the excess energy will charge the battery via SUN 12/14/16K-SG. \\nFinally, the stored energy can be released when the loads require it. The battery can also be charged by the diesel generator to ensure uninterrupted supply in the event of grid blackout.\\nDescription\\nSmart Monitoring Platform\\nThanks to the smart monitoring platform, Deye full series inverter products support remotely shutdown immediately when accident occurs. Setting parameters and FW update remotely, which makes PV plant O&amp;M easier.\\nDeye 16kw Hybrid Inverter Single Phase come with RS485/CAN port for battery communication.\\n<br></p><p><br></p>",

Then, the excess energy will charge the battery. You can use the excess energy in the battery when needed. The battery can also be charged by the diesel generator to ensure power supply in the event of power outage.\\n\\n### Smart Monitoring Platform\\nThanks to the smart monitoring platform, Deye full series inverter products support remotely shutdown immediately when accident occurs. Setting parameters and FW update remotely, which makes PV plant O&M easier.\\n\\nDeye 12kw Hybrid Inverter Single Phase come with RS485/CAN port for battery communication.",
