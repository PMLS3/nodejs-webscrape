This model boasts 3 MPPTs for various complex rooftops, thus leading to high power efficiency. The ultra-low 50V startup voltage allows inverters to kick in earlier during the day and presents more power generation. In addition, by supporting up to 20A DC max. input current per MPPT, the MS G3 Series is ideal for high-power modules, which makes full use of power generated and presents lower LCOE. Importantly, PID (potential induced degradation) recovery function is supported for better module performance.
